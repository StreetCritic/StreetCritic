              Do you think there's a very nice or very awful way missing? If so,
              those should be added first before considering ways that are more
              average.

            <Text>
              A way <strong>should not be too long,</strong> e.g. don't add a
              way that consists of different sections that people would rate
              differently, e.g. a way along a street where the first half
              consists of a well build bicycle track, and the other half having
              none at all. On the other hand, a way may be long and may consists
              of differently named streets if the properties are similar.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              Different ways <strong>may overlap</strong>. But don't add a new
              way when a really similar way already exists.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              If you want to rate a rather short section of a street that is in
              very bad shape, it's fine to add a way for that.
